Software Test Plan 
This section describes the testing plans for testing the HACS software.  In general, this includes the user acceptance test (UAT) and the functional testing.  Moreover, it is assumed that the next level of testing is performed only when every test plan in the previous testing level has been carried out without any error. 
The main objectives of this software test plan are:
•	To validate that the HACS system works according to the requirements specified in the SRS.
•	To identify any defects, errors, or inconsistencies in the system before it is delivered to the Client.
•	To provide a structured and traceable framework for testing that ensures all critical features are checked.
•	To define the roles, responsibilities, and methodology for both functional and user acceptance testing.

 
2.1 User Acceptance Test Plan 
The User Acceptance Test (UAT) Plan focuses on verifying that the HACS software satisfies the critical user requirements and is ready for client demonstration. Only the essential features that the client will interact with during the acceptance testing are included here.
Before performing UAT:
•	Ensure all functional tests are completed successfully.
•	Verify that all critical features such as account creation, appliance control, and scheduling are functioning as expected.
•	Whenever possible, refer to the relevant functional test case section instead of duplicating information.
The UAT plan maps the system features to the requirements in the SRS, ensuring that each critical user requirement is covered.

2.2 Functional Test Plan 
The Functional Test Plan ensures that the HACS system works according to the detailed functional specifications in the SRS. Each test case verifies core system functionalities, including appliance management, user authentication, and scheduling operations.
Functional testing is performed before UAT, to guarantee that all features are implemented correctly and no errors exist.
