. Requirements Traceability
This section documents the relationship between the requirements specified in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and the corresponding test cases identified in this Software Test Document (STD).
The traceability ensures that:
•	Every requirement in the SRS has been validated by at least one test case.
•	No test case exists without a corresponding requirement (to prevent redundant testing).
•	The coverage of all functional and non-functional requirements can be clearly verified.
Traceability also allows both the Agile Architects development team and the Client to confirm that all intended functionalities of the Home Appliance Control System (HACS) have been tested and validated successfully.
The table below lists each requirement ID (as per the SRS) and maps it to the corresponding test cases defined in this document. “X” marks indicate the presence of a test case that validates that particular requirement.
